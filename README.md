Welcome to mining tycoon! Please read this text to know how to use it. **NOTE: THIS README IS FOR WINDOWS ONLY.**
## What is Mining Tycoon?
Mining Tycoon is a tycoon game where you manage a company selling ores. You have to manage your income, money, resources and workers to be the best in the game!
## Installation
To install Mining Tycoon, click on the green button that says "Code"

After that, locate the ZIP file, it is most likely going to be in your "Downloads" folder. It should look like this:

Right-click the ZIP file and click "Extract All"

You should see this window. Do not change any settings, just press "Extract". Once you have done that, double-click on the folder "Mining-Tycoon-main" and create a new folder

Name it "saves". Do not add any capitalisation, just "saves". This will be where all your saved files will go in.

After you have done that, you can start playing the game by running "main.exe"! However, it is recommended to read the instructions on how to play if you're new.
## Instructions
Once you run "main.exe", Windows might prevent it from running because it is an unrecognised app. If you feel uncomfortable running the game, that is perfectly fine. But if you want to continue, click "More info" and click "Run anyway".
It might take some time to run the game, so be patient.
Once the game has finished loading, you are met with a welcome message and 2 buttons:

Since you don't have any saved files yet, click on "New Game".

Once you have done that, pick a game name, and make sure the name meets all the following requirements:
- The name cannot be empty.
- The name must only contain basic letters. (e.g. abcdef...)
- The name must contain 20 characters or less.
- The name cannot only contain spaces.
- The name cannot start with a space.

The name I picked for this tutorial is "Game", you can pick any name of your choice. After you have chosen your name, click "Submit".
Now you should see this screen:

You will see boxes to manage your mining empire. The first one is "Information". This shows all the info about your tycoon. This includes the following:
- Miners
- Drillers
- Money
- Income
- Resources

To hire a driller/miner, go to the "Hiring" section. Click on which worker you want to hire and it will be in your unassigned workers. Keep in mind that you have to pay them wages. To get them to work, go to the "Mining" section and you will see all your mines.
Enter the number of drillers/miners you want to mine by assigning them with the respective entries. Once you have done that, click "Submit" and they will start mining. Once they have found an ore, they will add it to your storage. To sell an ore, go to the "Selling" section.
Enter the amount of a resource you want to sell and sell it using the button next to it. Keep in mind you cannot sell more than you have.

If you are short on money all your workers will quit their jobs since they are not getting paid. To prevent this, unassign the workers working in your mines by choosing 0 miners/drillers then go to the "Firing" section and fire them. This will get your income back and you can sell resources to get money back before it's too late.

To save your game, click on the "Save Game" button below the "Selling" box. This will make a save file in the "saves" folder you created earlier (I hope). To load your previous game, run the game and instead of clicking "New Game", click on "Load Game". You should see the window.

Click on the game you want to load and you can continue playing!
